--- The rules ---
1) No previews - of either results or assets!
2) Stay in this editor at all times
3) No measurement tools
4) Stop coding when the time's up
5) Use the "Download file" button and save the file as [your-nick-name].html then upload it here.

Good luck and most important of all; have fun!
